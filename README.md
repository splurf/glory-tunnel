# glory-tunnel

## Hosting
`./glory-tunnel --host <ADDR:PORT> <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>`

## Joining
`./glory-tunnel --connect <ADDR:PORT> <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>`

**USERNAME** doesn't have to be the same in order to join the other person. It is only an identifier.

**ADDR:PORT** and **PASSWORD** need to match eachother.
